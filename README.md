# Hamiltonian_Learning_GNN
Repository containing basic code to perform GNN training and testing over TFIM datasets.


## Installation
The installation is very basic. The source files to train the PNA GNN are contained in the folder `./Equilibrium/HamL`. In the text file `./env_requirements.txt`, the Python packages are listed out and can be installed recursively using the following commands `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` and `python3 -m pip install -r ./env_requirements.txt`. The Python version used in this project is 3.9.11.

## Basic usage 
A basic example of the code usage is given in this repository. This example aims to reproduce Fig. (4) in the paper which concerned all training scenarios.
